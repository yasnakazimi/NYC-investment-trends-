Startup Funding Analysis – New York City

This project explores the relationship between startup funding, industry sector, and success outcomes within New York City’s vibrant startup ecosystem. Using a real-world dataset of investment records, the analysis examines how funding amounts and rounds relate to whether startups become acquired, remain operating, or close down.

## Key steps included: 

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed and validated raw investment data to remove missing values and ensure accuracy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Visualized funding distribution across industries using R (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse).

## Statistical Modeling:
Built a logistic regression model to predict startup success based on funding amount and industry type.

## Insights:
Found that higher funding strongly correlates with acquisition likelihood, especially in Enterprise Software, while Clean Technology and Biotechnology sectors showed lower success rates despite high funding.
Tools Used: R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, janitor, scales
